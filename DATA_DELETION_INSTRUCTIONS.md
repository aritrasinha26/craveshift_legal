## What Data is Deleted

When you reset your progress, the following data is permanently deleted:

- ✅ **Personal Information**: Your name (if provided during onboarding)
- ✅ **Food Scan History**: All scanned foods and analysis results
- ✅ **Usage Data**: Your scanning history, preferences, and app interactions
- ✅ **Progress Data**: Knowledge points, level, and achievements
- ✅ **Streak Data**: Daily scan streaks and streak history
- ✅ **Cached Data**: Food analysis cache and smart pairing cache
- ✅ **Insights Data**: Personalized insights and pattern analysis
- ✅ **Usage Limits**: Daily scan counts and pairing usage

## Data Not Stored Locally

The following data may be processed temporarily but is not stored in the app:

- **Food Images**: Images are sent to OpenAI for analysis but are not stored on your device after processing
- **Third-Party Services**: 
  - Purchase/subscription data is managed by RevenueCat (subject to their privacy policy)
  - Food analysis is processed by OpenAI (subject to their privacy policy)

## Additional Notes

- **Instant Deletion**: Data deletion is immediate and cannot be undone
- **No Server Storage**: Since data is stored locally on your device, deleting it from the app removes it completely
- **Subscription Data**: If you have an active subscription, cancellation should be done through your app store (Google Play or App Store) account settings. This will stop future charges but may not immediately delete purchase records from RevenueCat's systems.
